# IDP Dynamics Project
We try to identify general rules governing sequence-dependant dynamics in IDPs by performing Molecular Dynamics simulations.
These codes were used to analyse data and plot figures for the paper: Sequence-Dependent Backbone Dynamics of Intrinsically Disordered Proteins, now in bioRxiv (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.02.11.480128v1). A major part of these codes were adapted from Dr Alan Hicks (https://github.com/achicks15/CorrFunction_NMRRelaxation) and further modified to include additional analysis.
