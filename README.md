# IDP Dynamics Project
For intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), a pressing question is how sequence codes for function. Dynamics serves as a crucial link, reminiscent of the role of structure in sequenceâ€“function relations of structured proteins. To define general rules governing sequence-dependent backbone dynamics, we carried out long molecular dynamics simulations of eight IDPs. Blocks of residues exhibiting large amplitudes in slow dynamics are rigidified by local inter-residue interactions or secondary structures. A long region or an entire IDP can be slowed down by long-range contacts or secondary-structure packing. On the other hand, glycines promote fast dynamics and either demarcate rigid blocks or facilitate multiple modes of local and long-range inter-residue interactions. The sequence-dependent backbone dynamics endows IDPs with versatile response to binding partners, with some blocks recalcitrant while others readily adapting to intermolecular interactions.

A major part of these codes were adapted from Dr Alan Hicks (https://github.com/achicks15/CorrFunction_NMRRelaxation) and further modified to include additional analysis.
